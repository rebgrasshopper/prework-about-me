      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a software development student, a parent, a sometimes ukulele player, and a weaver.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've lived a lot of places in the US. I once spent 11 years in the Pacific Northwest though. It was wet.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobby is learning things. Sometimes languages, music, gardening, or weaving. I also like to just sit as a hobby. Parenting doesn't leave enough time for that, so the odd chance to do so is incredibly refreshing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a culturally laid back but active workplace where I code, solve problems, run tests, and interact with coworkers. It should also pay enough that I can live in San Diego and send my kid to day care.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in San Diego. It's beautiful here. Everyone's always complaining about the lack of seasons. I don't know what they're looking for, but I love that slight change from summer to autumn, winter, and spring. I've experienced cold winter, rainy winter, and San Diego winter, and San Diego winter wins. The Pacific Northwest may win for most beautiful summer, but 3 months can't make the rest of the rain worthwhile.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because coding is like a fun little puzzle cube, only I can do it. I don't have that physical/spatial brain for those toy puzzles, but the coding puzzles seem to slide into place after a bit of work, and it's so satisfying. In addition, I like being useful. There's so much you can DO with coding. I've got friends who are changing the world! I want to help.</p>
